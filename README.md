# Starbugs

>In the past, you start coding with a cup of coffee every day, for example, Starbucks.<br/>
>In the future, you check the list of the 'star bugs' after coding for 8 hours, for example, Starbugs.

This projects collect impressive, interesting, nonsense, meaningful and fucking bugs. For instance, a number bug that caused hundreds of millions of losses, or a typing bug that caused ten hours service unavailable.

Let's say something bad, to make everyone happy.

Come on, for a cup of starbugs.
